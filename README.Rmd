# packageC

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of packageC is to make a minimal example using C code in R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of packageC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jstatlab/packageC")
```

## Example

Follow a basic example:

```{r example}
library(packageC)

y <- cumsum(rnorm(1e5))

plot(y, col = "grey")
lines(exp_smooth(y, 0.8), col = 2)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
